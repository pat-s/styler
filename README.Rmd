The goal of styler is to provide non-invasive pretty-printing of R source code
while adhering to the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org) formatting rules.
styler can be customized to format code according to other style guides too.

The following online docs are available:

- [latest CRAN release](https://styler.r-lib.org).

- [GitHub development version](https://styler.r-lib.org/dev).

## Installation

You can install the package from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("styler")
```

If you don't use styler interactively (i.e. not from the R prompt or RStudio 
Addin), make sure you authorize `{R.cache}` once to set up a permanent cache. 
If you use it interactively, you will be asked to grant this permission once.
See `?caching` for details.


Or get the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/styler")
```

## API

You can style a simple character vector of code with `style_text()`:

```{r}
library("styler")
ugly_code <- "a=function( x){1+1}           "
style_text(ugly_code)
```

There are a few variants of `style_text()`:

* `style_file()` styles .R, .Rmd .Rnw and .Rprofile, files.

* `style_dir()` styles all .R and/or .Rmd files in a directory.

* `style_pkg()` styles the source files of an R package.

* RStudio Addins for styling the active file, styling the current package and
  styling the highlighted code region.

```{r, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzwalthert/some_raw_data/master/styler_0.1.gif")
```

## Configuration

You can decide on the level of invasiveness with the scope argument. You can
style:

* just spaces.

* spaces and indention.

* spaces, indention and line breaks.

* spaces, indention, line breaks and tokens.

```{r}
ugly_code <- "a=function( x){1+1}           "
style_text(ugly_code, scope = "spaces")
```

Note that compared to the default used above `scope = "tokens"`:

* no line breaks were added.

* `<-` was not replaced with `=`.

While spaces still got styled (around `=` in `(x)`).

This was just the tip of the iceberg. To learn more about customization options
with the tidyverse style guide, see the [help file for
`tidyverse_style](https://styler.r-lib.org/reference/tidyverse_style.html) for a
quick overview or the [introductory
vignette](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/introducing_styler.html).

## Features

* style roxygen2 code examples.

* do not re-style [deliberate code
  alignment](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/detect-alignment.html).

* [ignore some lines](https://styler.r-lib.org/dev/reference/stylerignore.html)
  for styling.

* [cache styled
  expressions](https://styler.r-lib.org/dev/reference/caching.html) for speed.

## Adaption of styler

styler functionality is made available through other tools, most notably

* as a pre-commit hook `style-files` in
  https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit

* `usethis::use_tidy_style()` styles your project according to the tidyverse
  style guide.

* via commenting a PR on GitHub with `\style` when the [GitHub
  Action](https://github.com/features/actions) [*Tidyverse
  CI*](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#tidyverse-ci-workflow)
  is used. The most convenient way to set this up is via
  [`usethis::use_github_actions_tidy()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html?q=ghactions#use-github-actions-tidy-).

* `reprex::reprex(style = TRUE)` to prettify reprex code before printing. To
  permanently use `style = TRUE` without specifying it every time, you can add
  the following line to your `.Rprofile` (via `usethis::edit_r_profile()`):
  `options(reprex.styler = TRUE)`.

* you can pretty-print your R code in RMarkdown reports without having styler
  modifying the source. This feature is implemented as a code chunk option in
  knitr. use `tidy = "styler"` in the header of a code chunks (e.g. ` ```{r
  name-of-the-chunk, tidy = "styler"}`), or `knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy =
  "styler")` at the top of your RMarkdown script.

* Adding styler as a fixer to the [ale
  Plug-in](https://github.com/w0rp/ale/pull/2401#issuecomment-485942966) for
  VIM.

* pretty-printing of [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow data
  frames with `drake::drake_plan_source()`.

* Adding styler with
  [emacs-format-all-the-code](https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code)
  for Emacs.

## Further resources

* The official [web documentation](https://styler.r-lib.org/) of styler,
  containing various vignettes function documentation as well as a change-log.

* The wiki of [Google Summer of Code
  2017](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/Noninvasive-source-code-formatting)
  or the [pkgdown](https://r-lib.github.io/styler/) page contain information
  related to the initial development phase during Google Summer of Code 2017.

## Contributing

Please have a look at `CONTRIBUTING.md`, in particular, make sure to use the 
pre-commit hooks and if you skip a hook, describe why in the PR. 
See the `{precommit}` [README.md](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit) 
on how to install the pre-commit framework and the R package on your system and 
then run
```{r, eval = FALSE}
precommit::use_precommit()
```

to make sure the hooks are activated in your local styler clone.
