\description{
Caching makes styler faster on repeated styling. It does not cache input
but output code. That means if you style code that already complies to a
style guide and you have previously styled that code, it will be quicker.
Code is cached by expression and the cache is shared across all APIs (e.g.
\code{style_text()} and Addin.
}
\section{Setup}{

styler by default uses caching via the \code{{R.cache}} package. You will be
asked to let it create a permanent cache on your file system that styler
will use in case it is not set already up for another tool that
uses \code{{R.cache}}. We encourage users to let \code{{R.cache}} create a permanent
directory for caching because, otherwise, the cache is lost at restart of R.
}

\section{Non-interactive use}{

Note that if you have never authorized \code{{R.cache}} to create the cache in a
permanent directory, it will build the cache in a temporary directory. To
create a permanent cache, just open an interactive R session and type
\code{cache_info()}. You can see under \verb{Location:} if a permanent directory is
used and if not, \code{{R.cache}} will ask you to create one the first time you
use \code{{R.cache}} in an R session.
}

\section{Invalidation}{

The cache is specific to a version of styler by default, because different
versions potentially format code differently. This means after upgrading
styler or a style guide you use, the cache will be re-built.
}

\section{Manage the cache}{

See \code{\link[=cache_info]{cache_info()}},
\code{\link[=cache_activate]{cache_activate()}}, \code{\link[=cache_clear]{cache_clear()}} for utilities to manage the cache. Since
we leverage \code{{R.cache}} to manage the cache, you can also use any \code{{R.cache}}
functionality to manipulate it.
}

\section{Using a cache for styler in CI/CD}{

If you want to set up caching in a CI/CD pipeline, we suggest to set the
\code{{R.cache}} root path to a directory for which you have the cache enabled.
The former can be done with \code{R.cache::setCacheRootPath("/path/to/cache")},
the latter can often be set in config files of CI/CD tools, e.g. see the
the \href{https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching}{Travis documentation on caching}.
